On April 2, 2020 the US CDC [finally recommended the use of face masks for the general population](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html), partially recognizing what public health experts have known all along.  Lacking broad herd immunity (The 461,432 confirmed US caseson  April 10, 2020 represens only 1.37% of the population, so even if the actual infection rate is much larger almost all the population are potential hosts.) the only measures slowing the spread of Covid-19 are human actions - distancing, washing, and stopping the exchange of respiratory droplets carrying the virus.  The CDC contnues to discourage the use of surgical masks and N-95 respirators, seeking to reserve dwindling supplies for health and medical personnel. 
As [anticipated by community health providers](https://ppe4cc.org) this devil's choice of protecting yourself and those around you versus protecting those in health professions has become irrelevant.  
The [national stockpile](https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/COVID19/SNS/Pages/default.aspx) is
[essentially depleted](https://q13fox.com/2020/04/08/federal-stockpile-of-n95-respirators-other-protective-equipment-nearly-depleted/), demand vastly outstrips production and continues to grow, and supply chains of traditional commercial masks remain seriously compromised.  

We must take a different national approach.  *Manufacture massive quantities of masks and other PPE that provide strong protection through channels available in communities everywhere using locally available materials and develop operational protocols for safe re-use.*
