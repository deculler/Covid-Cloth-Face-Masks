On April 2, 2020 the US CDC [finally recommended the use of face masks for the general population](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html), partially recognizing what public health experts have known all along.  Lacking broad herd immunity or innoculation the only measures slowing the spread of Covid-19 are human actions - distancing, washing, and stopping the exchange of respiratory droplets carrying the virus.  (The 461,432 confirmed US caseson  April 10, 2020 represent only 0.14% of the population, so even if the actual infection rate is an order of magnitude larger almost all the population are potential hosts.) The CDC [provides DIY guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html), but continues to discourage the use of surgical masks and N-95 respirators, seeking to reserve dwindling supplies for health and medical personnel. As [anticipated by community health providers](https://ppe4cc.org) this devil's choice of protecting yourself and those around you versus protecting those in health professions has become irrelevant.  The [national stockpile](https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/COVID19/SNS/Pages/default.aspx) is [essentially depleted](https://q13fox.com/2020/04/08/federal-stockpile-of-n95-respirators-other-protective-equipment-nearly-depleted/), demand vastly outstrips production and continues to grow, and supply chains of traditional commercial masks remain seriously compromised.  Health professionals are going to need alternatives to turn to **this week**, regardless.

We must take a different national approach.  *Manufacture massive quantities of masks and other PPE that provide strong protection through channels available in communities everywhere using locally available materials and develop operational protocols for safe re-use.*  Protect the population **and** those who care for us.  No occupation should be done without masks.  Every step of the food chain, those harvesting the fields, shipping to stores, in the grocery store, cooking or serving - all should be protected and protecting others.  No marketing concern - "people will fear that X is not safe if our workers wear masks" - is worth dying for.

This approach means the use of fabric and filter materials that are widely available throughout the economy, rather than relying on the specialized materials and mechanisms narrowly provided for [traditional suppliers](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1.html).  It means the use of manufacturing methods that are indemic in our communities - *sewing*.  It means using local production for immediate delivery.  These enable rapid ramp to scale directly to the faces that need the PPE.

Many good designs have been developed and put into production in some manner, from DIY to [fashion](https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/fashion-brands-cotton-face-masks-coronavirus-47377462).  One developed at 
[Project PPE 4 Central Coast](http://ppe4cc.org) in conjunction with the Monterey and Santa Cruz Medicial Societies is described here.  The mask consists of front and back parts forming an interstitial pocket that can hold an optional filter - [ HEPA vacuum bag](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-materials-diy-face-masks-filters_l_5e8ce4c6c5b6e1a2e0fb4ada), coffee filter, anti-static face mask material, whatever.  Each of the parts are formed of two 100% cotton layers of
reasonably high thread count.  One layer is straight cut (with the grain of the fabric) and one bias cut (on a 45 degree) so that the varying overlap can reduce porocity and increase interception.  The pattern, modeled on the traditional N-95, provides a snug fit around the nose, along the cheeks, and under the chin to reduce escape.  A simple modable wire is sewn in to the front layer to form the nose bridge.  Washing in soapy water for repeated use.  Sewing and assembly instructions are available at [ppe4cc.org](http://ppe4cc.org).

For many individuals, a [simpler 2-Layer mask](https://about.kaiserpermanente.org/content/dam/internet/kp/comms/import/uploads/2020/03/02_COVID_Mask-Instructions_v9.pdf) may be a more approachable alternative.  It is easier to sew and requires less material.  These designs provide a DIY avenue for individuals and community groups to protect themselves, but also provide ways to [mobilize production resources in the community](http://goodtimes.sc/santa-cruz-news/new-santa-cruz-group-making-face-masks-for-covid-19-pandemic/).  The can potentially be produced by essentially any company working with textiles - apparel manufacturers, backpacks, outdoor gear, sail makers, sewing contractors, etc.
