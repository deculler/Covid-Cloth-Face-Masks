On April 2, 2020 the US CDC [finally recommended the use of face masks for the general population](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html), partially recognizing what public health experts have known all along.  Lacking broad herd immunity or innoculation the only measures slowing the spread of Covid-19 are human actions - distancing, washing, and stopping the exchange of respiratory droplets carrying the virus.  (The 461,432 confirmed US caseson  April 10, 2020 represens only 1.37% of the population, so even if the actual infection rate is much larger almost all the population are potential hosts.) The CDC contnues to discourage the use of surgical masks and N-95 respirators, seeking to reserve dwindling supplies for health and medical personnel. As [anticipated by community health providers](https://ppe4cc.org) this devil's choice of protecting yourself and those around you versus protecting those in health professions has become irrelevant.  The [national stockpile](https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/COVID19/SNS/Pages/default.aspx) is [essentially depleted](https://q13fox.com/2020/04/08/federal-stockpile-of-n95-respirators-other-protective-equipment-nearly-depleted/), demand vastly outstrips production and continues to grow, and supply chains of traditional commercial masks remain seriously compromised.  

We must take a different national approach.  *Manufacture massive quantities of masks and other PPE that provide strong protection through channels available in communities everywhere using locally available materials and develop operational protocols for safe re-use.*  Protect the population **and** those who care for us.

This means the use of fabric and filter materials that are widely available throughout the economy, rather than relying on the specialized materials and mechanisms that are narrowly available for [traditional suppliers](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1.html).  It means the use of manufacturing methods available in all our communities - sewing.  And, it means using local production for immediate delivery.  These enable the rapid ramp to scale that our health system requires.

Many good designs have been developed and put into production in some form, from DIY to [fashion](https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/fashion-brands-cotton-face-masks-coronavirus-47377462).  One developed at 
[Project PPE 4 Central Coast](http://ppe4cc.org) in conjunction with the Monterey and Santa Cruz Medicial Societies is described here.  The mask consists of a two parts forming an interstitial pocket that can hold an optional filter - [ HEPA vacuum bag](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-materials-diy-face-masks-filters_l_5e8ce4c6c5b6e1a2e0fb4ada), paper towel, anti-static face mask material, whatever.  Each of the front and back parts are formed of two 100% cotton layers of
reasonably high thread count.  One layer is straight cut (with the grain of the fabric) and one bias cut (on a 45 degree) so that the varying overlap prevents the alignment of threads that might permit channels.  The pattern is modeled on the traditional N-95 to provide a snug fit around the nose, along the cheeks, and under the chin.  A simple modable wire is sewn in to the front layer to form the nose bridge.  Sewing and assembly instructions are available at [ppe4cc.org](http://ppe4cc.org).

For many individuals, the [simpler 2-Layer Mask recommended by Kaiser Permanente](https://about.kaiserpermanente.org/content/dam/internet/kp/comms/import/uploads/2020/03/02_COVID_Mask-Instructions_v9.pdf) may be a more approachable alternative.  It is easier to sew and requires less material.  These designs provide a DIY avenue for individuals and community groups to protect themselves, but also provide ways to [mobilize production resources in the community](http://goodtimes.sc/santa-cruz-news/new-santa-cruz-group-making-face-masks-for-covid-19-pandemic/).  The can potentially be produced by essentially any company working with textiles - apparel manufacturers, backpacks, outdoor gear, sail makers,
